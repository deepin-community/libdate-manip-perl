libdate-manip-perl (6.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Renamed one Date::Manip::Recur method

  The Date::Manip::Recur::base method has been renamed to basedate.  The
  Date::Manip::Recur::base method should return the Date::Manip::Base object
  like all the other Date::Manip modules.

  Reworked recurrences

  Recurrences were reworked in a (slightly) backward incompatible way to
  improve their usefulness (and to make them conform to the expected
  results). Most recurrences will work the same, but a few will
  differ.

  Cf. `man Date::Manip::Changes6' or `perldoc Date::Manip::Changes6'.

libdate-manip-perl (6.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  As of Date::Manip 6.14, the 5.xx release is fully integrated into the
  distribution. Both will be installed automatically and you can switch
  between them. Cf. `man Date::Manip' or `perldoc Date::Manip'.

libdate-manip-perl (6.04-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Some rather significant changes have taken place between 5.xx and
  the new version 6 series of Date::Manip. While the upstream author
  has attempted to maintain backward compatibility, some changes may
  break your software.

  * Broken into smaller modules
    Rather than a large monolithic module, this module's parts can
    be used where appropriate

  * Intermediate data cached
    To improve performance, the module caches some data internally.
    If you try to memoize this data yourself, you'll end up using
    much more memory than necessary.

  * Taint safety
    The modules are now taint safe internally, but obviously you
    must still untaint data that you feed the module yourself.

  * Changed behaviour for recurrences
    Parsing recurrences specified in English has been removed in
    ambiguous cases. Statements like "every 2nd Tuesday" result
    in different day numbers based on the year, for example.

  For full details of all the changes that have happened, please
  see the included Date::Manip::Changes5to6. While the upstream
  author believes the issues will likely not have any impact, it
  is important to understand the changes and provided workarounds.
